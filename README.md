# university-website_basics

This was a school project before i made changes to it.

The web application is a site that has ITS System like the one you would find on any university website. The aim was to allow a student to register, add modules/courses and make changes to their profile where needed. An administrator also would have a page to view students who qualifies to get into certain programmes and do the usual admin staff.

I however didn't finish Adding Modules to the code for the student because of time.... Bootstrap has been used to write the front-end system with a litle of javascript for rotation of cards. I'll update this as soon as i finish my exams.
